How to setup Corebot:

(Dont Forget)
You need to have node.js installed. We also suggest a program to use to edit the bot like Atom!


1. Make sure all files are extracted
2. Locate the config.yml file found in the CoreBot folder.
3. Configure each setting to look custom for your server! (prefix, bot-token, hex color, etc etc)
4. Double click the start.bat file to run your bot.
5. Run the -install command to setup all channels & roles.

Server Status:
To connect your server to the server status command
1. Open the Corebot folder and locate the config.json file and open it then scroll all the way down.
3. Change the server name to yours.
4. Change the GameModeNameOne setting to your server's gamemode.
5. Change the GamemodeOneURL link to match your server's IP and port.
5. Change the GameModeOneQueryURL link to match your server's IP and QUERY port. PLEASE NOTE: THE QUERY PORT WILL NOT ALWAYS BE THE SAME AS YOUR SERVER'S PORT. YOU NEED TO GO TO YOUR server.properties FILE TO GET THE CORRECT QUERY PORT.
6. Change the Gamemode1url link to match your server's IP & port.
